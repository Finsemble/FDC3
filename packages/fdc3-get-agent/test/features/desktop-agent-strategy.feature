Feature: Different Strategies for Accessing the Desktop Agent

  Background: Desktop Agent API
    Given a browser document in "document" and window in "window"
    And Testing ends after "8000" ms

  Scenario: Running inside a Browser and using post message with direct message ports
    Given Parent Window desktop "da" listens for postMessage events in "{window}", returns direct message response
    And we wait for a period of "200" ms
    And I call getAgent for a promise result with the following options
      | dontSetWindowFdc3 | timeout | intentResolver | channelSelector |
      | true              |    8000 | false          | false           |
    And I refer to "{result}" as "theAPIPromise"
    Then the promise "{theAPIPromise}" should resolve
    And I refer to "{result}" as "desktopAgent"
    And I call "{desktopAgent}" with "getInfo"
    Then "{result}" is an object with the following contents
      | fdc3Version | appMetadata.appId | provider          |
      |         2.0 | cucumber-app      | cucumber-provider |
    And I refer to "{document.body.children[0]}" as "channel-selector"
    And I refer to "{channel-selector.children[0]}" as "iframe"
    And "{window.fdc3}" is undefined
    And "{window.events}" is an array of objects with the following contents
      | type    | data.type     |
      | message | WCP1Hello     |
      | message | WCP3Handshake |
    Then I call "{document}" with "shutdown"
    And I call "{desktopAgent}" with "disconnect"

  Scenario: Running inside a Browser using the embedded iframe strategy
    Given Parent Window desktop "da" listens for postMessage events in "{window}", returns iframe response
    And we wait for a period of "200" ms
    And I call getAgent for a promise result with the following options
      | dontSetWindowFdc3 | timeout |
      | false             |    8000 |
    And I refer to "{result}" as "theAPIPromise"
    Then the promise "{theAPIPromise}" should resolve
    And I refer to "{result}" as "desktopAgent"
    And I call "{desktopAgent}" with "getInfo"
    Then "{result}" is an object with the following contents
      | fdc3Version | appMetadata.appId | provider          |
      |         2.0 | cucumber-app      | cucumber-provider |
    And I refer to "{document.iframes[0]}" as "embedded-iframe"
    Then "{embedded-iframe}" is an object with the following contents
      | tag    | atts.name           | style.width | style.height |
      | iframe | FDC3 Communications |         0px |          0px |
    And I refer to "{document.iframes[1]}" as "intent-resolver-iframe"
    And I refer to "{document.iframes[2]}" as "channel-selector-iframe"
    Then "{channel-selector-iframe}" is an object with the following contents
      | tag    | atts.name             | atts.src                              | style.width | style.height |
      | iframe | FDC3 Channel Selector | https://mock.fdc3.com/channelSelector |        100% |         100% |
    Then "{intent-resolver-iframe}" is an object with the following contents
      | tag    | atts.name            | atts.src                       | style.width | style.height |
      | iframe | FDC3 Intent Resolver | https://mock.fdc3.com/resolver |        100% |         100% |
    And "{window.fdc3}" is not null
    And "{window.events}" is an array of objects with the following contents
      | type      | data.type     |
      | message   | WCP1Hello     |
      | message   | WCP2LoadUrl   |
      | message   | WCP3Handshake |
      | message   | iframeHello   |
      | message   | iframeHello   |
      | fdc3Ready | {null}        |
    Then I call "{document}" with "shutdown"
    And I call "{desktopAgent}" with "disconnect"

  Scenario: Running inside an Electron Container.
    In this scenario, window.fdc3 is set by the electron container and returned by getAgent

    Given A Dummy Desktop Agent in "dummy-api"
    And I call fdc3Ready for a promise result
    And I refer to "{result}" as "theAPIPromise"
    And we wait for a period of "500" ms
    And `window.fdc3` is injected into the runtime with the value in "{dummy-api}"
    Then the promise "{theAPIPromise}" should resolve
    And I call "{result}" with "getInfo"
    Then "{result}" is an object with the following contents
      | fdc3Version | appMetadata.appId | provider          |
      |         2.0 | cucumber-app      | cucumber-provider |
    Then I call "{document}" with "shutdown"

  Scenario: Failover Strategy returning desktop agent
    Given A Dummy Desktop Agent in "dummy-api"
    And "dummyFailover" is a function which returns a promise of "{dummy-api}"
    And I call getAgent for a promise result with the following options
      | failover        | timeout |
      | {dummyFailover} |    1000 |
    And I refer to "{result}" as "theAPIPromise"
    Then the promise "{theAPIPromise}" should resolve
    And I call "{result}" with "getInfo"
    Then "{result}" is an object with the following contents
      | fdc3Version | appMetadata.appId | provider          |
      |         2.0 | cucumber-app      | cucumber-provider |
    Then I call "{document}" with "shutdown"

  Scenario: Failover Strategy returning a proxy
    Given "dummyFailover2" is a function which opens an iframe for communications on "{document}"
    And I call getAgent for a promise result with the following options
      | failover         | timeout |
      | {dummyFailover2} |    1000 |
    And I refer to "{result}" as "theAPIPromise"
    Then the promise "{theAPIPromise}" should resolve
    And I call "{result}" with "getInfo"
    Then "{result}" is an object with the following contents
      | fdc3Version | appMetadata.appId | provider          |
      |         2.0 | cucumber-app      | cucumber-provider |
    Then I call "{document}" with "shutdown"

  Scenario: Recovery from SessionState
  Here, we recover the details of the session from the session state, obviating the need to 
  make a request to the parent iframe.

    Given Parent Window desktop "da" listens for postMessage events in "{window}", returns direct message response
    And an existing app instance in "instanceID"
    And the session identity is set to "{instanceID}"
    And we wait for a period of "200" ms
    And I call getAgent for a promise result with the following options
      | dontSetWindowFdc3 | timeout | intentResolver | channelSelector |
      | true              |    8000 | false          | false           |
    And I refer to "{result}" as "theAPIPromise"
    Then the promise "{theAPIPromise}" should resolve
    Then I call "{document}" with "shutdown"
    And I call "{desktopAgent}" with "disconnect"

  Scenario: Failed Recovery from SessionState
  App tries to recover with an ID that doesn't exist.

    Given Parent Window desktop "da" listens for postMessage events in "{window}", returns direct message response
    And we wait for a period of "200" ms
    And the session identity is set to "BAD_INSTANCE"
    And I call getAgent for a promise result with the following options
      | dontSetWindowFdc3 | timeout | intentResolver | channelSelector |
      | true              |    8000 | false          | false           |
    And I refer to "{result}" as "theAPIPromise"
    Then the promise "{theAPIPromise}" should resolve
    And "{result}" is an error with message "Invalid instance"
    Then I call "{document}" with "shutdown"

  Scenario: Nothing works and we timeout

  Scenario: Someone calls getAgent twice
    Given Parent Window desktop "da" listens for postMessage events in "{window}", returns direct message response
    And we wait for a period of "200" ms
    And I call getAgent for a promise result with the following options
      | dontSetWindowFdc3 | timeout | intentResolver | channelSelector |
      | true              |    8000 | false          | false           |
    And I refer to "{result}" as "theAPIPromise1"
    And I call getAgent for a promise result with the following options
      | dontSetWindowFdc3 | timeout | intentResolver | channelSelector |
      | true              |    8000 | false          | false           |
    And I refer to "{result}" as "theAPIPromise2"
    Then the promise "{theAPIPromise1}" should resolve
    And I refer to "{result}" as "desktopAgent1"
    And the promise "{theAPIPromise2}" should resolve
    And I refer to "{result}" as "desktopAgent2"
    And "{desktopAgent1}" is "{desktopAgent2}"
    Then I call "{document}" with "shutdown"
    And I call "{desktopAgent}" with "disconnect"
