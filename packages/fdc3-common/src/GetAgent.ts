/** 
 * Function used to retrieve an FDC3 Desktop Agent API instance, which  
 * supports the discovery of a Desktop Agent Preload (a container-injected  
 * API implementation) or a Desktop Agent Proxy (a Browser-based Desktop Agent 
 * running in another window or frame). Finally, if no Desktop Agent is found, 
 * a failover function may be supplied by app allowing it to start or otherwise 
 * connect to a Desktop Agent (e.g. by loading a proprietary adaptor that 
 * returns a `DesktopAgent` implementation or by creating a window or iframe of 
 * its own that will provide a Desktop Agent Proxy. 
 * 
 * @param {GetAgentParams} params Optional parameters object, which  
 * may include a URL to use for the app's identity, other settings 
 * that affect the behavior of the getAgent() function and a `failover`  
 * function that should be run if a Desktop Agent is not detected.  
 *  
 * @returns A promise that resolves to a DesktopAgent implementation or  
 * rejects with an error message from the `AgentError` enumeration if unable to 
 * return a Desktop Agent implementation. 
 * 
 * @example  
 * const fdc3 = await getAgent();
 * 
 * // OR 
 * 
 * getAgent({ 
 *     identityUrl: "https://example.com/path?param=appName#example",  
 *     channelSelector: false,  
 *     intentresolver: false 
 * }).then((fdc3) => {

/** 
 * @typedef {Object} GetAgentParams Type representing parameters passed to the 
 * getAgent function. 
 * 
 * @property {string} identityUrl The app's current URL is normally sent to 
 * a web-based desktop agent to help establish its identity. This property 
 * may be used to override the URL sent (to handle situations where an app's 
 * URL is not sufficiently stable to use for identity purposes). The URL set 
 * MUST match the origin of the application (scheme, hostname, and port) or  
 * it will be ignored. If not specified, the app's current URL will be used.  
 * 
 * @property {number} timeout Number of millisecs to allow for an fdc3  
 * implementation to be found before calling the failover function or 
 * rejecting (default 1000). Note that the timeout is cancelled as soon as a 
 * Desktop Agent is detected. There may be additional set-up steps to perform 
 * which will happen outside the timeout. 
 * 
 * @property {boolean} channelSelector Flag indicating that the application  
 * needs access to a channel selector UI (i.e. because it supports User Channels 
 * and does not implement its own UI for selecting channels). If not set will 
 * default to true. MAY be ignored by Desktop Agent Preload (container)  
 * implementations. 
 * 
 * @property {boolean} intentResolver Flag indicating that the application  
 * needs access to an intent resolver UI (i.e. because it supports raising on or 
 * more intents and and does not implement its own UI for selecting target apps. 
 * If not set will default to true. MAY be ignored by Desktop Agent Preload  
 * (container) implementations. 
 * 
 * @property {boolean} dontSetWindowFdc3 For backwards compatibility, `getAgent` 
 * will set a reference to the Desktop Agent implementation at `window.fdc3` 
 * if one does not already exist, and will fire the fdc3Ready event. Setting  
 * this flag to `false` will inhibit that behaviour, leaving `window.fdc3` unset. 
 *  
 * @property {function} failover A optional function that provides an  
 * means of connecting to or starting a Desktop Agent, which will be called 
 * if no Desktop Agent is detected. Must return either a Desktop Agent  
 * implementation directly (e.g. by using a proprietary adaptor) or a  
 * WindowProxy (e.g a reference to another window returned by `window.open`  
 * or an iframe's `contentWindow`) for a window or frame in which it has loaded 
 * a Desktop Agent or suitable proxy to one that works with FDC3 Web Connection 
 * and Desktop Agent Communication Protocols.
