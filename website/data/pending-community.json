The goals were:\nTo continue the previously funded work around anti-fraud in mobile money systems and the typologies and assessment models developed in partnership with Deloitte and others.\nBuild an effective and efficient API driven transactional monitoring engine that can be consumed in full or in part by any organization desiring to consume it and build around it.\nRun large or small anti-fraud programs.\nThe system must be state of the art and use only open-source components. MVP is complete. Onward!",
